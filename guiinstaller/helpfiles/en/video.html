	<title>Chosing driver for a videocard</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Choosing a driver</h2>
	<p>By default, xorg detects a driver automatically. If your video card fails to work with this, choose a specific driver instead. Good fallback variants are fbdev, modesetting and vesa.</p>
	<p>ATM, Intel GMA500/600/3600/3650 and other PowerVR-based cards are known to work only with fbdev or modesetting drivers, specified manually.</p>

	<h2>Special note for NVIDIA users</h2>
	<p>If you wish, you can choose a proprietary driver for your card. If you prefer this, choose a driver corresponding to your video card's model: new driver won't work with old cards.</p>
