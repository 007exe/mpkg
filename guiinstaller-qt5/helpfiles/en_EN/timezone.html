	<h1>Setting time zone</h1>
	<p>Here you must choose timezone for your system. You can type first leeters from your town's name, and choose proper time zone.</p>
	<p>You can check the box "Clock in UTC, not localtime", and if checked your system's hardware clock will be set to UTC time. It's good practice, if you haven't Windows on your PC</p>
